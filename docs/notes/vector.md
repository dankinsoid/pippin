## Vector (Sources/CljCore/vector.c)

- [ ] **`clj_vector_from_array` is a conj loop**: the leaf grows through `clj_realloc` one slot at a time,
  ~13 size-class moves per 32 elements. Trigger: reader or `vec` on large inputs showing in a profile.
  Fix: build full leaves directly and push them.
- [ ] **`conj` is 10× a mutable `Array` append** (bench/RESULTS.md): wrapper and tail ownership checks,
  a retain, and a `clj_realloc` that moves at every size-class boundary. Trigger: a conj loop in a
  profile. Fix: transients (one owner, no checks), or a tail allocated at slack capacity.
- **No identity short-circuit in `assoc`**: storing the element already there still copies the path
  when shared and resets the hash cache. Clojure does the same.
- **Index and count are `uint32_t`**; a negative index from a higher layer must be rejected there.
