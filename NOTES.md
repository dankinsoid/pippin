# Engineering notes

Known simplifications in the runtime, each with the event that makes it worth fixing.
Delete an entry when it is done. Architecture-level decisions live in clojure-apple-design.md.

## Allocator (Sources/CljCore/alloc.c)

- **Abandoned slabs.** A thread's slabs are never reclaimed after it exits; freed cells in them are
  lost. Trigger: first code that creates short-lived threads (core.async, GCD workers). Fix as mimalloc:
  pthread_key destructor moves the heap's slabs to a global abandoned list; heaps take from it before
  mapping a new slab.
- **Empty slabs are never returned to the OS.** Peak memory stays resident. Trigger: first run on a
  device (jetsam). Fix: `madvise(MADV_FREE)`/`munmap` when empty slabs per class exceed a threshold,
  plus a memory-warning hook.
- **Foreign free list drains only when the local list is empty.** With a producer thread allocating
  from bump cells and a consumer freeing, cells pile up unused until the slab is exhausted. Not a leak,
  a delay. Trigger: multi-threaded benchmark showing extra resident memory in producer/consumer runs.
- **Linear search for a slab with room** when the current one is full. Trigger: a profile showing it;
  unlikely.

## RC (Sources/CljCore/rc.c, object.h)

- **Live-object counter is one process-wide atomic** (debug only). Trigger: debug builds visibly slow
  under many threads. Fix: per-thread counters summed on read.
- **Copy path retains every child and then replaces one slot**: one spare retain/release pair per
  level. Trigger: profiling the "all versions kept" benchmark scenario.

## Map (Sources/CljCore/map.c)

- **`clj_debug_hash_override` is checked on every `clj_hash`** even in release (one global load +
  branch). Trigger: it shows in a profile.

## Symbol / keyword (Sources/CljCore/symbol.c, keyword.c)

- **Symbols carry no metadata slot.** Trigger: the reader attaching `:line`/`:column`, or `with-meta`
  on a symbol. Add a `meta` value slot (nil by default) and visit it in `each_child`.
- **Keyword intern table is one global map under one mutex**, and interning allocates a temporary
  symbol for the lookup even on a hit. Trigger: keyword literals resolved at runtime in a hot path
  (the reader/analyzer resolves them once, so unlikely). Fix: sharded tables or a lock-free read path.
- **A string is limited to 4 GiB** (`uint32_t len`); `clj_string_new` aborts beyond that.

## Benchmarks (bench/)

- Numbers drift between sessions (thermal, background load). Compare only within one run; use
  `CLJ_SYSTEM_ALLOC=1` on the same binary as the control.
- Not yet measured: multi-threaded reads of a shared map, assoc from a shared base across threads,
  cross-thread free, cost of `clj_share` on a large graph.
