# Benchmark results

ns per op, median of 5 runs, each run batched to ~1M operations. `make bench` runs the same binary
with the pool allocator and then with `CLJ_SYSTEM_ALLOC=1` as the control. Numbers drift between
sessions; compare only within one invocation.

Results recorded before this harness (commits fd4cbf4, 7f54fcf) measured a 10-op scenario as one
~1 µs interval and are not comparable; they stay in git history only.

## 8533784 — Apple M3 Pro, 36 GB, Swift 6.2.4

Pool allocator (C) vs system malloc (C, control); Swift columns are the same code in both runs.

Swift columns agree within 1–4 % across the two runs, so the C pool / C malloc delta is the allocator.
